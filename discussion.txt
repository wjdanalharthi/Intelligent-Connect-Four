DESCRIBTION: this file discusses the performance of different AI players
	     and the evaluation function performance. 
"""

Assumptions and Constants:
	All assumptions and constants values are defined `global.jl` file.
	Constants such as Monte Carlo's exploration constant C and the
	default Lookaheads for Minimax and Expectiminimax.
	The maximum lookahead I was able to get to without slowing the execution
	by much is 6. As for the exploration constant C, I tried different values
	ranging between 0.8-1.5. Theoritically 1.4 seems to be the best, and I
	noticed a good performance overall (examples below).	

AI Algorithms
	- Minimax
		ran with depth = 3 by default. I reserve 4 numbers for special
		cases, which are:
		{typemin(Int32), typemax(Int32), typemin(Int32)-1, typemax(Int32)+1}
		First special case is when we haven't explored any columns,
		the Maximizer will have a score of typemin(Int32)-1, that is
		the most minimim number - 1 (smaller than most minimum). And
		vice-versa for the Minimizer (has value of typemax(Int32)+1). 
		Second special case is when the player or his opponent is 
		winning in the next move. If the current player is a Maximizer
		and he is winning, he gets a score of typemax(Int32) to force 
		him to take the move to win. If a maximizer opponent is winning,
		however, then he gets typemin(Int32) to force him to take the move
		to block his opponent. Vice-versa for the minimizer. 		

		Other than that, the current player will make moves and simulate his
		opponent's moves until depth == 0 or the board is full, or a winner
		is found. After that states get evaluated and chosen by Maximizers
		and Minimizers.
 
	- Expectiminimax
		ran with depth = 3 by default. I reserve 2 numbers for one special 
		case which is the player is winning or his opponent {typemin, typemax}.
		For the first 2 layers (of depth), I try all columns of layer 2 for
		each state in layer 1. For the remaining layers (up to depth), the 
		regular Minimax is used to obtain the scores. Finally, I aggregate
		each layer's scores and average them (multiply by probability of 
		choosing a column). 
		After obtaining the score from Expectiminimax, I run pure Minimax
		on the same board and obtain its scores (deterministic). 
		I compare the two scores and I choose one best for the current player.
		If the score from Expectiminimax is chosen, a isRandom flag is passed
		to force the opponent to play randomly. 

	- Monte Carlo
		I explore all states until a leaf node, keeping track of statistics,
		including number of visits and wins. I use 10,000 simulations. 
		For selection, if all children have been explored, the I use UCT to
		choose the child with the best UCT score, otherwise I randomly choose
		an unvisited child. 
		I chose the exploration constant to be equal to SquareRoot(2), or 1.4
		as it showed a good performance overall, and a good balance between
		expanding and exploiting.
		I initialize the child's statistics and keep expanding and selecting
		until simulations are done. I propagate the statistics and calculate
		the ratios of win/plays, and select the column that leads to the
		highest ratio. 


Heuristic and Evaluation Function
	I created an evaluation functions that is based on the consecutive number of
	checkers. The goal is for both players to minimize the remaining number of
	checkers to complete a sequence of 4. I check all possible directions, starting
	at all possible slots, and I return a score per column, being the number of
	remaining checkers. 
	For a better indication of the number of remaining checkers, I also count the
	number of overhead checkers. Overhead checkers are the ones that are not part
	of the checker sequence, but they are needed for the sequence to be completed.
	The scores for the Maximizer are multiplies by -1 for him to maximize it (choosing
	the smallest number of remaining checkers), and for the minimizer to minimize
	the positive score.
	An example of scores for the board below:
	 |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
	 | X |   |   |   |   |   | 
	 | X |   | O | O | O |   | 
	 | O | O | O | O | X |   | 
	 | X | O | X | X | X |   | 
	---------------------------
	   1   2   3   4   5   6
	
	For checker O:
		vertical = (2,2): your best shot is playing at column 2, you have 2 remaining
		horizontal = (1,2): best move would be at 2 because you have 1 remaining (winner)
		diagonalUp = (1,5): play at 5 because you have 1 remaining (winner)
		diagonalDown = (3,2): you have 3 remaining to get a full diagonal down sequence.
					Here is where the overhead checkers come in play.
				       	We see that we need 2 `O` checkers in cols 1 and 2 
				       	to complete the sequence in cols 3 and 4. However, we need
				       	an extra "overhead" checker in col 2 (O or X) to raise the
				       	'O' checker to be part of the sequence.

	For checker X:
		vertical = (5,6): best move would be at col 6, there is no chance in any other col!
		horizontal = (1,6): you have 1 remaining, play at column 6
		diagonalUp = (4,2): no sequences can be completed, play at 2
		diagonalDown = (4,2): no sequences can be completed, play at 2 


Different Runs of The Game:
	I will go through some runs of the game between different types of players. 
	I think a game between a Minimax player and a Monte Carlo player shows off 
	how well the two algorithms perform by seeking a win when possible, and blocking
	an opponent's win when needed, and showing the goodness of the Minimax eval functions. 
	Below is a game on a 6x7 board, between Minimax (lookahead=3) and Monte Carlo
	I deleted some of the turns as they were not interesting.

	Comment: but little did the Minimax player knew! He helped MCST player
		build a diagonal down sequence starting at [3, 2] ending at [6, 5]
	Monte Carlo wins!

	=========================================
	
	Here is a very interesting game in my opinion between Expectiminimax and
	Monte Carlo. This game involved alot of blocking. I shows off how well 
	both Monte Carlo and Expectiminimax/Minimax evaluation functions detect 
	winning of their opponents. It also shows off how randomness of Expectiminimax 
	increases its chances of winning sometimes, and how Expectiminimax intelligently
	plays deterministically when it is, or its opponent is close to winning.

	Comment: with a random move, player X increased his chances of winning with
		a horizontal sequence. Since Player O is now forced to play randomly, 
		there is a 1/7 probability that he will block X's win.

	Comment: we see that the random move that O made did not block X's sequence.
		Player X evaluated the board and realized there is a chance of winning.
		Hence, instead of making a random move, it deterministically used Minimax
		to complete the sequence and win!
