"""


1) Provide an upper bound for the number of positions in
Connect Four on a 7Ã—6 board. Explain how you derived your answer.

>>> for each slot in a board of size MxN, we have 3 possible states,
which are checker X, checker O, or empty. So we have 3^(MxN) possibilities.
Hence, for a 6x7 board size, we have 3^42 possibilites. 


3) Implement an intelligent agent to play Connect Four using
the Minimax algorithm. How many plys can you look ahead? What is the
branching factor of your game tree?

>>> The lookahead I can get to is 7 or 8, after that it gets much slower.
As for the branching factor, it depends on the available columns that a 
player can add to. The maximum is 7 for a board with 7 columns, and the
minimum is 1 when there is only one column left.
